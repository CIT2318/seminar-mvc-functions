#MVC Recap

Open index.php in a text editor

1. What do you think this page will look like when viewed in a browser?
2. How would you structure this page using the MVC pattern.
    * First go through the code and use comments to highlights the parts of the code that relate to models, views and controllers
    * Have a go at creating separate model, view and controller files based on this page. Structure the code as functions
    * Don't attempt to run the code. We don't want to get caught up in importing database tables, fixing syntax errors etc. We simple want to think about the structure and organisation of the code.
3. Now have a look at insert.php, how would you re-structure page to use the MVC pattern.
